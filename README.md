# flutter_template

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

1: By Default Font Family is Effra -- Use standart Text Widget for that
2: To use OpenSans -- context.openSansTextStyle().copyWith(// You can add your font size and color
etc here)  // (This function will give you TextStyle widget)
3: When ever you have to use the color use following context.gc(AppColor.body1) of headline1 etc
AppColor is enum (If you want to add new color in AppColor before doing that ask for permission form
Ahsin Irshad) If you see orange color that means provided color is not available. maybe in dark mode
or in light mode.
